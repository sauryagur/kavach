# Project Kavach Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Network Foundation

### Week 1-2: Project Initialization

* Set up repository structure for Rust backend and React Native frontend.
* Implement BATMAN-adv for layer 2 mesh networking.
* Configure libp2p for efficient peer-to-peer message routing.
* Set up WebRTC for real-time data transfer between nodes.
* Implement basic encryption and message integrity checks.
* Build initial data flow for message creation, routing, and geofencing.

### Week 3-4: Geofencing and Basic Messaging

* Implement geofencing logic for message filtering.
* Add GPS location-based routing and proximity detection.
* Test local message delivery within the mesh network.
* Integrate SQLite for offline message caching.
* Set up basic government broadcast system for prioritized messages.
* Establish initial UI for message creation and status notifications.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features and Optimization

### Week 5-6: Secure Communication

* Add end-to-end encryption (NaCl or AES-256) for all messages.
* Implement digital signatures for message authenticity.
* Optimize data serialization for faster routing.
* Implement node health checks and self-healing logic.
* Add message acknowledgment and retry mechanisms.

### Week 7-8: Scaling and Long-Range Communication

* Integrate LoRa or satellite uplinks for long-range message transmission.
* Implement gateway node support for isolated mesh clusters.
* Optimize routing algorithms for latency and bandwidth efficiency.
* Conduct extensive field testing in variable network conditions.

## Phase 3: Finalization and Deployment

### Week 9-10: Mobile App Polishing

* Finalize React Native UI for seamless cross-platform experience.
* Implement push notifications for urgent messages.
* Add support for multiple languages and localization.
* Perform extensive UX testing and bug fixes.

### Week 11-12: Security Hardening and Final Tests

* Conduct penetration testing for security vulnerabilities.
* Implement additional privacy features (e.g., anonymous mode).
* Optimize battery and network usage for mobile devices.
* Prepare for beta release and community testing.

### Week 13-14: Deployment and Scaling

* Set up Docker for consistent deployment environments.
* Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated builds.
* Prepare detailed documentation for community contributors.
* Launch initial public release and gather user feedback.

## Long-Term Goals (Post-MVP)

* Advanced geofencing with AI-based threat detection.
* Integration with satellite imagery for real-time intelligence.
* Decentralized governance and reputation-based moderation.
* Automated emergency alerts and critical infrastructure monitoring.
